# Dijkstra's Pathfinding Visualizer

This project is a Dijkstra's Pathfinding Visualizer that allows users to visualize the process of Dijkstra's algorithm in real-time. Users can interact with the grid to set start and end points, draw walls, and watch the algorithm find the shortest path.

## How to Use

1. **Setup**: Clone the repository and open the project in your preferred web server or IDE.
2. **Open the Visualizer**: Open `src/index.html` in your web browser.
3. **Interacting with the Grid**:
   - Click and drag to create walls on the grid.
   - Click on a cell to toggle walls.
   - Set the start node (green) and end node (pink) by clicking on the respective cells.
4. **Run the Algorithm**: Click the "Start Algorithm" button to visualize Dijkstra's algorithm finding the shortest path.
5. **Clear the Grid**: Use the "Clear Grid" button to reset the grid and start over.
